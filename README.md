# ECE9039-Project

We used Colab for this project, and our dataset comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells). The results generated by our code are in the results.docx file, which you can open if needed. If you would like to run our code, please open it in Colab, upload kaggle.json, and then run all the cells to get the results.
